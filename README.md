# Loan-Prediction

### Using Logistic Regression to determine if a customer is likley, 
#or not, to accept an offer of a bank loan.
### Logistic Regression is very useful in determining the value of a binary variable
#(0/1, yes/no, approve/not approve, fraud/valid)
### We will load in 5000 records showing information on bank customers 
#to build a model that we can then apply to new data sets
### We can validat our model using histograms but there are many other
#ways to validate the mode.
